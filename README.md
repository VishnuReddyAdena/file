1. appending.py

This script:

    Prompts the user to enter text to write to a file named output.txt.

    Writes that input to the file (overwriting any existing content).

    Prompts for additional text to append.

    Appends the new input to the same file.

    Finally, reads and prints the full content of output.txt.
2. files.py

This script:

    Tries to open sample.txt in read-write mode (r+).

    If successful, it writes two lines to the file.

    Reopens and reads the file content for display.

    Gracefully handles the case when sample.txt is missing.
